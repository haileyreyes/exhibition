	<center><h2> This is my layered subject portrait reflection. Take a look to see the decisions behind my artistic choices.</h2></center>
	<p>For this project we had to create a layered portrait on photoshop for our interviewee that we talked to for Daramola’s assignment.</p>
	<p> Similar to the one that we created for ourselves.</p>  
	<p>The way I chose the images for my portrait and my mother’s portrait was a little different.</p>
	<p>With my images I tried to choose what pictures would best describe who I look forward to becoming in the upcoming year and, what goals I wanted to complete.</p>
	<p> Where as with my mother I tried my best to describe the person she is now and all of her achievements.</p>
	<p>For her achievements I put a few quotes and images that signified what she is proud of in life.</p>
	<p> I put a few family quotes in there because she constantly tells me and my sisters how proud she is of raising our family.</p> 
	<p> I put a quote about a happy home because she also makes sure she reminds herself of the home that she has provided her family.</p>
	<p> I also put a few images of just things she experiences in everyday life.</p>
	<p> A San Francisco image because she travels there often for work and she has grown to love it.</p>
	<p> I put something as silly as a Starbucks logo because she always makes sure to stop there every morning.</p> 
	<p>Some of our images had to connect to our history assignment.</p>
	<p> Our interviewee had to answer a question about a moment in history that they remember in their lifetime.</p>
	<p> In my mother’s portrait I put a few article pictures of the Bill Clinton Scandal, and the O.J Simpson trial, since those were the moments in history that my mother mentioned.</p>
	<p> I also put in a few pictures of the Casey Anthony trial and the Jodie Arias trial.</p>
	<p> My mother didn’t mention those moments but I remember her being glued to the t.v when those cases were televised.</p>  
	<p>As for the composition my photos, I made sure to showcase the articles I mentioned before at the corners of my portrait because I wanted those to be noticed but also not take away from the interviewee herself.</p>
	<p> When your looking at the portrait I want you to feel like your getting to know the person that was interviewed.</p>
	<p>The quotes I mostly made transparent or multiplied just so they could easily blend into other photos, giving those photos a chance to be seen.</p>
	<p> My central background was a picture of  Zacatecas, Mexico. I chose this background as what I ultimately wanted all my pictures to blend into because that’s where my mother was born, where she came from.</p>
	<p> I guess you can say that’s where it all started.</p>
