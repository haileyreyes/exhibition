	<li>“My name is Hailey Reyes, I am fifteen years old, it is January 25, 2018 and I am here with my mother Yexcneiz Contreras.”</li>
	<p>“My name is Yexcneiz Contreras, I am 42 years old.”</p>
	<li>“When and where you born?”</li>
	<p> “Salazares, Zacatecas”</p>
	<li>Where did you grow up?</li>
	<p>“In California.  I was brought to the states when I was two months old.” </p>
	<li>What was your childhood like?</li>
	<p>“It was chaotic. There was six brothers and sisters, and so there was a lot of noise in the house and, it was a very small house. As we got older, my brothers married and their families came to live with us.” </p>
	<li>Where is your mom’s family from?</li>
	<p>“I have no clue. I think she is from Mexico City. The capital of Mexico.”</p> 
	<li>Your dad’s family? </li>
	<p>“That’s even more interesting I-I don’t know where he’s from. I think he’s from Zacatecas.”</p> 
	<li>Have you ever been to those places that you think they are from?</li>
	<p>“I believe I visited once, when my mom took me to visit my grandma but, I don’t specifically know where I was. I have only been to Mexico once.”</p>
	<li>What were those experiences like ?</li>
	<p>“Terrible. Terrible.” </p>
	<li>Please explain.</li> 
	<p>“Well you know most people think Mexico is beaches and ____. But I went to a ranch where there was nothing to do and, my grandpa still lived very ranch like therefore, there was no shower. They had to heat up water for me, I had to wait for it to heat up and they would sort of just pour it in a tub and, I had to throw water over my head using a small cup. I was fifteen, a teenager so I was miserable.”</p>       
	<li>What are the most important lessons you learned in life and where did those events happen?</li>   
	<p>“I think I learned that growing up too fast is not a good thing. I was a teen mom so that made my grow up really fast. I feel like I missed out on a lot of things I couldn’t live through because I had  children you know, I was a mom since the age of 18.” </p>
	<li>Based off of that, how has your life changed than what you had imagined?</li>   
	<p>“I imagined having a career in law. Looked forward to it when I was fourteen or fifteen. I really thought I was going to be a lawyer. And of course the fact that I was a teen mom did not allow me to because I had two children by the time I was nineteen. My focus then became on being a mom. So yes my life was definitely put on hold to create my family.”</p>
	<li>What is a moment in history that you personally remember?</li>  
	<p>“Very very drastic, I remember the Bill Clinton thing. Because I really thought Bill Clinton was a good president up until that point, and I really remember it being such national news. Also the O.J Simpson trial. I was in my office working and I saw the Bronco pass by and I remember that making huge news and it became one of the biggest trials in the century and I sat through t.v watching every single bit of it."</p> 
	<li>Is there anything you regret when it comes to learning more about your background? </li>  
	<p>“Yes I regret that my children don’t speak spanish. I regret that my spanish is somewhat limited. I now see that we have a very beautiful culture that I know nothing about because, I was never raised within my culture.” </p>
	<li>Has the way you have been raised influenced how you raised your own family? </li>   
	<p>“I guess so. Yeah because my children don’t know much about our culture other than you know eating tamales on Christmas and tacos at parties.” </p>
