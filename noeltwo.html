 <p> The sunlight comes in streaming through the window</p> 
<p>The light cascading over the bed as if taking its rest for the day</p>
<p>Bare feet thump against the floor, soft skin meeting hardwood</p>
<p>She waits and waits and waits but still, there’s nothing</p> 
<p>The  treasure  that usually hold all the answers she seeks has nothing to offer her today</p> 
<p>Nothing has chimed, nothing has buzzed</p> 
<p>Desperation floods her  as she watches her treasure sink deeper and deeper</p> 
<p>Into a dark ocean</p> 
<p>Afraid to make the wrong move</p> 
<p>Afraid to say the wrong words</p>
<p>She could only wonder how long she has to watch her thoughts drown before finally coming up for air</p> 
<p>Finally she sees it, light at the bottom of that sea</p> 
<p>She grabs onto it with all she can, keeping sure it stays within her view</p>
<p>The water seems to have answered her call and finally she hits the surface</p> 
<p>Taking in all the air she can, she answers back</p>
<p>Pushing at the waves with so much force, she nearly loses herself in the water</p>
<p>Joy envelopes her because now she isn’t going to sink</p> 
<p>She can stay afloat with the knowledge that someone was there to keep her up</p> 
<p>The connection she thought had sunk</p> 
<p>Swimming between what is now clear instead of dark waters </p>
