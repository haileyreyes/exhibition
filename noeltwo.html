<center><h2> For the timely solution project, we were given a photo from the Industrial Revolution to help us write a poem and create an art piece. For the Social Media collage we read two articles on any topic of our choice, to then do an art piece and a poem on. I chose Technology and Relationships. The top row is apart of the Industrial Revolution Project. The second row is the social media project.</h2></center>

 <center><h2>These are poems that I wrote for both the Child Labor and Social Media Topics. The social media poem is called Lost Connection. The child labor poem is called True Colors</h2></center>
 
<h6>Lost Connection</h6>
	<p> The sunlight comes in streaming through the window</p> 
	<p>The light cascading over the bed as if taking its rest for the day</p>
	<p>Bare feet thump against the floor, soft skin meeting hardwood</p>
	<p>She waits and waits and waits but still, there’s nothing</p> 
	<p>The  treasure  that usually hold all the answers she seeks has nothing to offer her today</p> 
	<p>Nothing has chimed, nothing has buzzed</p> 
	<p>Desperation floods her  as she watches her treasure sink deeper and deeper</p> 
	<p>Into a dark ocean</p> 
	<p>Afraid to make the wrong move</p> 
	<p>Afraid to say the wrong words</p>
	<p>She could only wonder how long she has to watch her thoughts drown before finally coming up for air</p> 
	<p>Finally she sees it, light at the bottom of that sea</p> 
	<p>She grabs onto it with all she can, keeping sure it stays within her view</p>
	<p>The water seems to have answered her call and finally she hits the surface</p> 
	<p>Taking in all the air she can, she answers back</p>
	<p>Pushing at the waves with so much force, she nearly loses herself in the water</p>
	<p>Joy envelopes her because now she isn’t going to sink</p> 
	<p>She can stay afloat with the knowledge that someone was there to keep her up</p> 
	<p>The connection she thought had sunk</p> 
	<p>Swimming between what is now clear instead of dark waters </p>

<h6>True Colors</h6>
	<p>Covered in dirt, tired, and overworked,</p> 
	<p>The little boy wears a smile on his face</p> 
	<p>But so little joy comes to be so easily replaced</p>
	<p>He works the longest hours to provide</p> 
	<p>But the longer he stays the longer he sets his childhood aside</p>
	<p>And  decides that it’s not worth it at all</p> 
	<p>The little boy has his hand resting against a wall</p>
	<p>But the rest that is desired doesn’t seem to rest well with the people making the call</p> 
	<p>To just fix something</p> 
	<p>To bring home anything</p> 
	<p>It doesn’t matter how much a child could be suffering</p> 
	<p>all that matters is the pay</p> 
	<p>But to pay attention is know that there has to be a way</p> 
	<p>For someone to just fix something</p> 
	<p>For someone to bring out anything</p> 
	<p>Anything that is wrong with the little ways that there are for a child to get hurt  come home and still get sent back to work</p> 
	<p>But he goes on anyway</p>
	<p>He goes because there isn’t a day</p> 
	<p>Where he can’t feel willing, where he can’t feel little</p> 
	<p>He smiles his biggest smile</p> 
	<p>The joy he has discovered he knows could only last a little while.</p>
